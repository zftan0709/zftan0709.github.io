## About me

* I am a master student at [Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research](https://cuicar.com/), focusing on autonomous vehicle research.

* My goal is to empower robots the ability to perceive and understand the world just like human being or even better than human being.

* My research interests lie primarily in the area of computer vision, including both geometric and learning method, particular in their application in simulataneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D reconstruction, and scene understanding.

* I received my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa state University in 2019.
